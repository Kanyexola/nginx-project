    <b><h2>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value! </h2></b>
    
    <p>if you've got lots of money and you're bit daft, NFTS are a great way to pay for somthing that 
        doesn't have any instrinsic value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on NFT bandwagon 
        and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice: spend the weekend 
        crafting an NFT and by this time next week, you'll be a millionaira.</p>

    <p>is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem!
        This CryptoPunk (left) is a steal at $6.6 million.which 
        makes Bag #748 (right) a total bargain at $.4 million.
        And by the way, that's not a VS Code screenshot we 
        included by mistake. The eight lines of white text on a
        black background is the actual NFT we're selling.

    <p>still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we, That's 
    why we're selling them, not buying them.</p>
